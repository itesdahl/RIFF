This is a 300x600 (RIFF 600) or 300x900 (RIFF 900) size DIY printer that can be built without spending a fortune. I encourage the use of second hand parts and will not provide any complete BOM listing specific new components. 

Some key information about my build:

Build plate 300 x 600 (assembly with 2 pcs 300x300 heat beds, 3 pcs in the 900) 
2020 and 2040 extrusions 
SKR 1.4 turbo and SKR Pico controllerboards 
Radxa Rock 3C SBC 
MGN 12H rails/carriage on Y and X. (350mm on X and 2x650 or 2x 950mm on Y)
12mm rods and bearings on Z 
Cartesian (the belts are a bit too long for corexy) 
Klipper firmware 
Dual Y steppermotors
Sensorless homing on X and Y 
Dragonburner with Sherpa micro 
2 x 360W 24V power supplies (3 x 360 24V in the 900 version)


Design and frame:

Cutting extrusions:

4x2020 775mm for Y (or 1075mm for the 900 version)
2x2020 450mm and 2x2040 450mm for X
6x2040 340mm for Z (or optionally 370mm)

Blind joints and corner plates plates:

Tap M5 holes in all 6 2040 Z extrusions (or minimum 4 of them as shown in the video)
Tap M5 holes in the top Y extrusion at least in one end. (The one facing the rear of the printer) 
Optional but recommended, tap Y-extrusions in both ends to provide for two extra sets of corner plates and a couple of cover plates
Drill access holes in all Y-extrusions to get to the button head screws in the Z-extrusions
Attach the front and rear corner plates. The front 2040 x extrusion should sit 40mm below the top of the Y-extrusion

Next step:

Check the frame for squareness and adjust/correct  as needed.
Mount the 4 z-motor mounts with M5 10mm bolts. The motor mounts makes the frame more rigid. Check the frame again for squareness.

Parts for the front and rear arms (heat bed sub assembly):

Front 1x366mm 2020 extrusion and 2x625 bearings

Rear 1x322mm 2020 extrusion

--- Video part 3
The 2020 extrusion for the x axis is 440mm

On my 600 build the 2020 extrusions for the bed assembly is 2 pcs 645mm. You have to check the bed mounts on your heat bed to determine if you need longer extrusions.
