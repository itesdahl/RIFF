# The RIFF 3D printer

All the files for the printer will be moved here after the Youtube build series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHk1C7nPAl80ZWU28OD7yWof3j6T3yG72 has been completed. 
Until then you can find the published STLs on: https://www.printables.com/model/1291703-the-riff-large-3d-printer

For now you'll find an early version of the CAD-model for the RIFF 600 here only. It's mainly for visual reference during a build and serious clean up remains. Use with caution and double check any dimensions before cutting mechanical components.
