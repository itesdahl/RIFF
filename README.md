This is the future home for the RIFF 600 and 900 large DIY 3D printers.
All the files for the printer will be moved here after the Youtube build series https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHk1C7nPAl80ZWU28OD7yWof3j6T3yG72 has been completed. 
Until then you can find the published STLs on: https://www.printables.com/model/1291703-the-riff-large-3d-printer
