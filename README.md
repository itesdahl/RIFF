# The RIFF 3D printer
All the files for the printer will be moved here after the Youtube build series has been completed. 
Until then you can find the published STLs her: https://www.printables.com/model/1291703-the-riff-large-3d-printer

For now you'll find an early version of the CAD-model here. It's mainly for visual reference during a build and serious clean up remains.
